WooCommerce Marketplace Mobile App is an app that will convert your Wordpress Woocommerce Marketplace into an app which will work on React Native.

React Native allows the creation of the app by using Javascript only. By revoking the requirement of any additional programming language like Kotline, Java and Other Languages. 

With the growth in industrial demand, the trend of e-commerce industry is moving from a single store and its owner to a marketplace structure. Where there are multiple sellers dealing with the customer.
